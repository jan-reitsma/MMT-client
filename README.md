Note: You will need a paid subscription from [https://www.modernmt.com]() for this tool to work.

API documentation by modernmt can be found here:

There are countless machine translation services freely available, 
so why bother creating writing this tool?
As a technical translator I am using CAT tools and which integrate
machine translation services already. 
For quick lookup of words, sentences, during work, this is a handy tool. 
Useful information: it shows a quality estimation on each translation.

As you can upload your own translation memories, ModernMT can use and update them.
In a later version I will integrate a functionality to use user translation memories.
