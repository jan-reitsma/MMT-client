Note: You will need a paid subscription from [https://www.modernmt.com]() for this tool to work.

ModernMT API documentation can be found here:

Why did I create this tool? 2 Reasons:
1. I am learning Python.
2. As a technical translator, this is a useful tool for me to have a quick manual lookup tool in all languages that are relevant for me.

The tool is pretty much self-explanatory.

## Features:
1. Window shows quality estimation of each translation.
2. Translation are always copied to the clipboard 
3. Easy to handle with keyboard (Alt-Enter for translate, Alt-C for clear)
4. Source and target language settings (top line) can be stored in __settings.json__ 
5. The API Key is stored in __api.json__

## Features I want to implement soon:
6. MT adaptation: use your own TMX files to improve the MT output
