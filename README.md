Why did I create this tool? 
As a technical translator I am using CAT tools that can use
machine translation APIs. However, it was useful for me to have a quick manual lookup tool in all languages that are relevant for me.
The tool is pretty much self-explanatory.

## Features:
1. Window shows quality estimation of each translation.
2. Translation are always copied to the clipboard 
3. Easy to handle with keyboard (Alt-Enter for translate, Alt-C for clear)
4. Settings (top line) are stored in __settings.json__ 
5. the API Key is stored in __api.json__

## Features to be implemented in future:
6. MT adaptation: use your own TMX files to improve the MT output
