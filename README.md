### GUI client for ModernMT machine translation API

![Screenshot.png](Screenshot.png)

Note: You will need a paid subscription from [https://www.modernmt.com]() for this tool to work.

API documentation by modernmt can be found here:

There are countless machine translation services freely available, 
so why bother creating this tool?
As a technical translator I am using CAT tools and which integrate
machine translation services already. 
But for quick lookup of words, sentences, during work, this is a handy tool. 
Useful information: the window shows a quality estimation below each translation.

Settings are stored in in _settings.json_ . The api key will be stored in a file __key.json__

As it is possible to upload your own translation memories to the ModernMT server, 
and utilize them, I will improve this tool in future and add functionality 
to utilize your own translation memories.
